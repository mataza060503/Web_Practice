      The Space Expo is an annual, student-run event that showcases recent developments in astronomy and space sciences and demonstrates
       how these developments can be applied to everyday life. The event includes student, 
       government and industrial exhibits, and features presentations from NASA, Ball Aerospace, Rockwell, and IBM. <br>

      The Space Expo will feature activities for the kids, including <i>Creating a Comet, 
        Building a Model Rocket, and The Inter-Galactic Scavenger Hunt</i>. Friday 
        is Students' Day, with school children in grades K-8 displaying astronomy and space 
        science projects and competing for individual and school achievement awards. <br>

      Professor Greg Stewart's famous astronomy show is also coming to the Space Expo. 
      Professor Stewart will show the wonders of the night sky and discuss the nature of 
      quasars, exploding stars, and black holes. Presentations will be at the Brinkman
